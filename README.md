## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on ** Threat detection in forests(audio classification) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is trained to classify different sound categories using spectrograms as input features. 

## ✨ Features
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Converts raw audio into spectrogram images.
- **CNN Model Training**: Uses a deep learning model to classify audio data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Includes confusion matrices, accuracy plots, and validation curves.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies various transformations to improve model robustness.
- **Pre-trained Model Support**: Supports loading and testing pre-trained models.

## 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Audio-Classification-Using-CNN.git
cd Audio-Classification-Using-CNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Data Preparation
- Ensure audio files are in `dataset/`.
- Convert audio to **Mel spectrograms** using `librosa`.
- Normalize the data and apply augmentations.

## 🚀 Model Training
Train the CNN model using:
```python
python train.py  # If using a script
```
Or run the Jupyter Notebook `train.ipynb` step by step.

## 🎯 Model Evaluation
- **Performance Curves**: Training and validation accuracy/loss.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows classification performance.
- **Test Set Evaluation**: Predict on holdout test data.

## 📌 Usage
Load and test a pre-trained model:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('models/best_enhanced_multiclass_model.h5')
```

## 📈 Results
- **Classification Accuracy:** XX% (Replace with actual accuracy)
- **Best Performing Classes:** XYZ
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation included in the notebook.

## 🤖 Future Improvements
- Implement **attention mechanisms** for better feature extraction.
- Try **transformer-based models** for audio classification.
- Expand dataset for better generalization.
